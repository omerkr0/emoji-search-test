# Patika.dev Front-end Practicum Testing Homework

I have done this homework during Front-end Practicum

All test files are in  `src/tests`  folder.

## Homework Requirements

-   Write test code that will check if the header is rendered successfully. ✅
-   Write the test code that will check that the emoji list is rendered successfully when the app is first opened. ✅
-   Write test code that will check that when a filter is done, the emoji list is re-rendered according to that filter. ✅
-   When clicking any emoji on the list, write the test code that will check that the relevant emoji is copied. ✅

In this homework, we used the "Emoji Search" example. You can go to the [original repository here](https://github.com/ahfarmer/emoji-search)
